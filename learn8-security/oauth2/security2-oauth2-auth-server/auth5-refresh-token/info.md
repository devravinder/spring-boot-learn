## Changes to observe
 - for the client `offline_access` scope is added
 - we are using manual configuration...bcz we were unable to set expiration for token using application.properties



### Imp
- refresh token grant is authorization_code with offline_access scope 
- to get the access token we should use authorization_code grant
    - we should send offline_access
    - then the auth server sends refresh token along with access token

- `Then Why refresh_token grant ?`
  - the refresh_token grant is used by the auth client...to get the new tokens, when they expire
