# RabbitMq vs Apache Kafka

## üîë High-Level Purpose
- RabbitMQ: 
    - A message broker for traditional messaging patterns (work queues, pub/sub, request/reply).

- Kafka:
   - A distributed event streaming platform for high-throughput, durable, ordered logs of events.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Differences
1. Message Handling
    - RabbitMQ
    
        - Push-based delivery: broker pushes messages to consumers.
        
        - Supports acknowledgments, retries, dead-letter queues.
        
        - Messages are typically removed from the queue once consumed.
    
    - Kafka
    
        - Pull-based delivery: consumers poll messages from brokers.
        
        - Messages are stored on disk in append-only logs.
        
        - Messages are not removed after consumption 
           - they remain available until log retention policy expires.

2. Data Retention

    - RabbitMQ
      - Message is gone once acknowledged (unless requeued or persisted in a DLQ).
    
      - Focus = reliable delivery to consumers.
    
    - Kafka
    
      - Messages are kept for a configured time window (e.g., 7 days), regardless of consumption.
    
      - Multiple consumers can read the same message independently at different times.

3. Ordering Guarantees

    - RabbitMQ
    
      - Guarantees ordering only inside a single queue.
      - If multiple consumers compete on the same queue, order is not guaranteed.
    
    - Kafka
    
      - Guarantees ordering within a partition. 
      - Stronger ordering guarantees in high-throughput systems.

4. Throughput & Scalability

    - RabbitMQ
      - Great for moderate workloads (tens/hundreds of thousands of msgs/sec).
      - Scaling is harder because queues can become bottlenecks.
    
    - Kafka
      - Designed for high throughput (millions of msgs/sec).
      - Scales horizontally using partitions and consumer groups.

5. Use Cases

    - RabbitMQ (Messaging broker)
      - Task distribution (work queues).
      - Traditional enterprise integration (request/reply).
      - Reliable message passing between microservices.

    - Kafka (Streaming platform)
      - Event sourcing & event-driven architectures.
      - Real-time analytics pipelines.
      - Log aggregation.
      - Microservices communication at scale.

üìù Example Analogy
  - RabbitMQ is like a post office:
     - Messages are delivered to recipients.
     - Once picked up, they‚Äôre gone.
     - Good for reliable task delivery.

  - Kafka is like a newspaper archive:
     - Messages (events) are written to logs.
     - Everyone can read today‚Äôs newspaper, or last week‚Äôs, independently.
     - Good for replaying history and event streams.

| Feature    | RabbitMQ üêá                                  | Kafka ü¶Ñ                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Model      | Message Broker (queues, exchange)            | Distributed Event Log (topics, partitions) |
| Delivery   | Push                                         | Pull                                       |
| Retention  | Until consumed                               | Configurable (time/size)                   |
| Ordering   | Per queue (not guaranteed w/ many consumers) | Per partition (guaranteed)                 |
| Throughput | Medium (\~100K msgs/sec)                     | Very High (millions msgs/sec)              |
| Use Case   | Task queues, RPC, reliable messaging         | Event sourcing, streaming, analytics       |
