1. to rollback
    - there are some way to rollback... but they are not easy to maintain/execute
    - better a new change set to rollback the previous one


   eg:
    - in v4__add_unique_constraint_to_users.json rollback is there...but we are not using it
    - instead we are using v5__remove_unique_constraint_from_users.json
