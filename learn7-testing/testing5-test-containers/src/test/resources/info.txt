To run tests from cmd
 1. from root project
  $ ./gradlew :learn7-testing:testing5-test-containers:test

 2. for this project
  $ ../../gradlew test
=========================================================================


Why test containers are needed?
 1. Problems with static integration tests
    - assume we are using a database...and we want to test users count after adding data.
       But while adding...some other service may add data & count may not match... then test will fail.

     - to solve this, we need to run external services in isolation ( in containers ).


 2. Testing the real dependencies
     eg:
      - we can test the integration with real Postgres database
           instead of h2/in-memory database to mimic the postgres behavior.

 3. Same developer experience in Local & CI/CD environments
